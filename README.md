## Installation and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Motivation
The aim of this project is to find the correlation between the prices of accommodations in Airbnb Seattle and factors such as location, size, amenities offered, and other relevant characteristics. Additionally, it seeks to identify the factors that influence host ratings and their relationship with guest satisfaction.

With these goals in mind, the following questions are posed:

1. What is the correlation between accommodation prices and factors such as location, size, capacity, amenities offered, among others?

2. What are the key factors that influence the review scores given by guests to the listings?

3. What is the expected review score for listings without an assigned score, and how reliable is the estimation?

## Description of the Data Used
This project is based on the following datasets from Airbnb Seattle:
- **Listings**: Contains detailed information about Airbnb properties in Seattle, such as price, location, size, and amenities offered.
- **Calendar**: Provides information about availability and daily prices of Airbnb properties in Seattle.

## Project Description
The project is divided into the following stages:

### Exploration
In this stage, the Airbnb Seattle datasets (Listings and Calendar) will be loaded for further analysis. Data completeness, consistency, and variable selection related to the posed questions will be explored.

### Data Cleaning and Treatment
A thorough data cleaning process will be conducted, including the removal of outliers, format correction, and handling missing values. Furthermore, data will be processed to prepare it adequately for analysis.

### Modeling
In this stage, techniques for exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling will be applied to find the correlation between accommodation prices and the considered factors. The factors influencing host ratings and their relationship with guest satisfaction will be identified. Linear regression techniques will be employed to predict the expected review score for listings without an assigned score.
